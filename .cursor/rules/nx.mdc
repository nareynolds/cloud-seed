# Nx Monorepo Standards
- Follow Nx recommended project structure
- Use library boundaries to enforce separation of concerns
- Leverage Nx generators for creating new components
- Utilize Nx affected commands for efficient CI/CD

# Project Organization
- Place shared code in libs/
- Place deployable applications in apps/
- Use tags to categorize and enforce boundaries
- Follow consistent naming conventions

# Build and Test
- Use Nx caching for faster builds
- Configure distributed task execution with NxCloud
- Ensure all libraries have proper test coverage
